to do
-----
group fields into field groups
audit columns
encrypt passwords
password fields on user edit page
when rendering an Object, need to somehow configure how it should be displayed (which fields, format, etc)
	could be more than one field?
	could have special formatting (last name, first name)
viewing an object with no columns looks funny - probably should be a message instead
application selection should be sticky for user
have object selection "single relationship" be a popup (or ajax auto-complete)
define "calendars" containing 1 or more object/date
make paging and sorting an ajax request
add searching
define what goes on the home page

future
------
define charts/graphs
support rich text field with editor?
recognized blob types should have a specific icon (pdf, doc, xls, etc)
recognized blob types should be indexed for searching (pdf, doc, xls, etc)
built-in workflow definitions
"trigger" plug-ins
display (tabs, lists, relationships, etc) configurable by user
"active filters" on list views (i.e. status=open)
relationships can be viewed by list or tab (by user)
